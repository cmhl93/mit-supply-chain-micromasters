# Unit 1: Probability Basics

##  Managing Uncertainty 1

  * The Probability Mass Function
    * Probability of each discrete random variable
    * Probabilities sum to 100% or 1.00

##  Basic Probability Laws 1 & 2

  * Probability Theory
    * Mathematical framework for analyzing random events or experiments.
    * Experiments are events we cannot predict with certainty, e.g., weekly sales!

  * Notation
    * P(A) = probability that event A occurs,
    * P(B)= P(4) + P(5) = 0.34
    * P(C) = P(1) + P(3) + P(5) = .14 + .30 + .12 = 0.*     

  * P(A’) = complement of P(A) = probability some other event that is not A occurs
    * P(A’)= 1 – P(A) = 0.88
    * P(B’)= 1 – P(B) = 0.66
    * P(C‘) = 1 – P(C) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44

  * u= Union of sets (OR)
  * upside down u = Intersection of sets (AND)
  * =/= = Null or Empty set
  
  * Four Laws of Probability
    * Probability of any event is between 0 and 1
    * If A and B are mutually exclusive events, then
P(A or B) = P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B)

##  Basic Probability Laws 3 & 4

  * Conditional Probability
P(A|B) = Probability that Event A occurs, GIVEN THAT Event B has occurred.
e.g., P(D|C) = P[(Sales≤2) Given That (Sales=1, 3, or 5)]

  * If A and B are any two events, then
    P(A | B) = P(A and B)/ P(B) = P (A or B) / P(B)

  * P(A and B) = P(A or B) = P (A | B) P(B)
  
  * Independence - A and B are independent if knowing that B occurred
does not influence the probability of A occurring

  * If A and B are independent events, then P(A | B) = P(A)
  
  * P(A and B) = P(A or B) = P(A| B) P(B) = P(A) x P(B)
