##  Introduction to Logistics and Supply Chain Management

  * Every product is part of multiple supply chains
  * Characteristics - Banana, heels - perishabilities, style obsolete
  * Sourcing locations, components, end user
  * What is supply chain?
    * Two or more parties linked by a flow of resources - typically material, information, and money - that ultimately fulfill a customer request
      * Store places an order with their supplier
      * Supplier delivers requested material
      * Store pays supplier
      * During the process, there is a constant tranfer of information to update order status
      * Serial supply chain - one supplier to the next to the next
        * In reality it looks like a web
      * Downstream - closer to the customer
      * Upstream - closer to the supplier 
      * First tier or tier one suppliers are suppliers that sell directly to that firm.
      * The direction of a flow in a supply chain is often compared to a river, where downstream is closer to the customer and upstream is closer to the supplier.
    * The primary purpose of a SC is to satisfy customer needs
      * Only one source of revenue - the customer
      * Payments between parties are just fund exchanges
      * Division of intra-SC payments are a function of power, market condition, 
      etc.
      * Supply Chains try to maximize the total value generated
       * = (What customer pays) - (Total effort expended to fulfill)
    * What are logistics and supply chain management?
      * Logistics involves managing the flow of items, information, cash and ideas through the coordination of supply chain processes and through the strategic addition of place, period and pattern values.
      * Supply chain management deals with the management of materials, information, and financial flows in a network consisting of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers.
      * According to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals
        * Logistics management is that part of supply chain management that plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services, and related information between the point of origgin and the point of consumption in order to meet customer requirements
        * Supply chain management encompasses the planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion, and all logistics management activities. Importantly, it also includes coordination and collaboration with channel partners, which can be suppliers, intermediaries, third party service providers, and customers.  In essence, supply chain management integrates supply and demand management within and across companies.
    * How should you view SCM?
      * Geographic flows - showing origins, destinations, and the physical routes
      * Risk management
      * Flow diagrams - showing the flow of materials, information, and finance between echelons.
      * Process View of Supply Chains
        * Four Primary Cycles
          * Customer order cycle
          * Replenishment cycle
          * Manufacturing Cycle
          * Procurement Cycle
        * Cycles occur between stages
          * Interactions differ at each stage
        * Not every SC will have all 4 cycles
      * Macro Process (Software) Perspective
        * Supplier Relationship Management
          * Sourcing
          * Negotiation
          * Buying
          * Design and Supply Collaboration
        * Internal Supply Chain Managemnet
          * Strategic Planning
          * Demand Planning
          * Supply Planning
          * Fulfillment
        * Customer Relationship Management
          * Marketing
          * Selling
          * Call Centers
          * Order Management
        * Different macro processes should be aligned
          * Fall under different groups (Marketing - CRM, Manufacturing - ISCM, Purchasing - SRM)
          * Forecasts, schedules, design, etc. should be coordinated
       * Supply Chain Operations Reference Model 
         * a set of metrics and supporting documentation to management the supply chain as a whole
         * Source, Make, Deliver
       * Traditional Functional Perspective
         * Purchasing/Procurement
           * What to buy from who
         * Inventory COntrol
           * How much to stock where

         * Customer Service
           * Geographic
           * Product line specific

           * Facility Location
           * Network Design
           * Demand Planning
    * What are the challenges
    * Why should you care?
      * Supply chains:
        * Span the globe and cannot be managed as an isolated function
        * Have become critical to any organization's operations
        * Connect function, division,s and business units within a firm as well as across firms
        * Evolved into being both a bridge and a shock absorber
