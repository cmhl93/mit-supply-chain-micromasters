##  Introduction to Logistics and Supply Chain Management

  * Every product is part of multiple supply chains
  * Characteristics - Banana, heels - perishabilities, style obsolete
  * Sourcing locations, components, end user
  * What is supply chain?
    * Two or more parties linked by a flow of resources - typically material, information, and money - that ultimately fulfill a customer request
      * Store places an order with their supplier
      * Supplier delivers requested material
      * Store pays supplier
      * During the process, there is a constant tranfer of information to update order status
      * Serial supply chain - one supplier to the next to the next
        * In reality it looks like a web
      * Downstream - closer to the customer
      * Upstream - closer to the supplier 
    * The primary purpose of a SC is to satisfy customer needs
      * Only one source of revenue - the customer
      * Payments between parties are just fund exchanges
      * Division of intra-SC payments are a function of power, market condition, 
      etc.
      * Supply Chains try to maximize the total value generated
       * = (What customer pays) - (Total effort expended to fulfill)
