# Unit 3: Data Management

##  Introduction to Data Management

  * There are several reoccurring issues that supply chain managers must be aware of as they are working with data:
    * Is the data clean?
    * Is the data complete?
    * What assumptions are you making about the data?
    * Are the results making sense? How can I check?
  * Other contributing factors:
    * Sensors
    * Internet of Things
    * Regulations
  * Complexity is driven by volume, velocity, variet, and veracity     
  
##  Example - TinyCo
  * Recall	How	to	Characterize	a	Distribu)on	
    * Central	Tendency	
    * Mode –	value	that	appears	most	frequently	
    * Median –	value	in	the	“middle”	of	a	distribu)on,	separa)ng	the	lower	from the	higher	half	
    * Mean (μ) –	sum	of values	multiplied by	their	probability	(expected	value)	
  * Spread	
    * Range	–	maximum	value	minus	minimum	value	
    * Inner	Quartiles	–	75th	percen)le	value	minus	the	25th	percen)le	value	
    * Variance	(σ2)	-	expecta)on	of	the	squared	devia)on	around	the	mean	
    *	Standard	Devia)on	(σ)	-		Square	root	of	the	variance			
    * Coefficient	of	Varia)on	(CV)	–	Standard	devia)on	over	the	mean	=	σ/μ
    
##  Cleaning data

  * Typical	checks	
    * Invalid	values	-	negative,	text,	too	small,	too	big,	missing	
    * Mismatches	between	related	data	sets	-	#	of	rows,	#	of	cols	
    * Duplication	–	unique	identifiers	
    * Human	error	–	wrong	dates,	invalid	assumptions	
    * Always	explore	the	outliers	–	they	are	the	most	interes)ng!

##  Querying data in spreadsheets

  * Pivot tables can help
    * Data summarization
    * They automatically sort, total or average the data stored in one table and display the results in a second table
