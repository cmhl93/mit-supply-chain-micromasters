# Unit 2: Models, Algebra and Functions

##  Analytic Basics

  * Decisioning making is at the core of supply chain management
    * How many facilities should I open and where?
    * What transportation option should I use?
    * How should I trade-off service and cost?
    * Where should I source my materials from?
    * How should I share risk with my customers/suppliers
    * What is my demand for next year?
    * How can I make my supply chain more resilient?
  
  * Analytical models are used to make supply chain decisions
  
  * Model Classification
    * Real World - Operational Exercise > Gaming > Simulation > Analytical Model
    * Categories of Mathematical Models
      * Descriptive - What has happened?
      * Predictive  - What could happen?
      * Prescriptive - what should we do
  
  * Simulation will not provide an optimal solution
  
  * The objective of a model is to be as close to reality as possible
  
  * Games will tend to provide more realism than an analytical model
  
  * Dynamic programming model is a good choice in order to generate strategy under uncertainty
  
  * We build prescriptive models for known and well defined functional forms
  
  * A simulation model is descriptive in a sense that its form is well defined, but decision variables are determined with uncertainty.
