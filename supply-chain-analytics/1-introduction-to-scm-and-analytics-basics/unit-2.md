# Unit 2: Models, Algebra and Functions

##  Analytic Basics

  * Decisioning making is at the core of supply chain management
    * How many facilities should I open and where?
    * What transportation option should I use?
    * How should I trade-off service and cost?
    * Where should I source my materials from?
    * How should I share risk with my customers/suppliers
    * What is my demand for next year?
    * How can I make my supply chain more resilient?
  
  * Analytical models are used to make supply chain decisions
  
  * Model Classification
    * Real World - Operational Exercise > Gaming > Simulation > Analytical Model
    * Categories of Mathematical Models
      * Descriptive - What has happened?
      * Predictive  - What could happen?
      * Prescriptive - what should we do
  
  * Simulation will not provide an optimal solution
  
  * The objective of a model is to be as close to reality as possible
  
  * Games will tend to provide more realism than an analytical model
  
  * Dynamic programming model is a good choice in order to generate strategy under uncertainty
  
  * We build prescriptive models for known and well defined functional forms
  
  * A simulation model is descriptive in a sense that its form is well defined, but decision variables are determined with uncertainty.
  
##  Mathematical Functions
  * Linear Function - y = ax + b
  * Profit = f(volume) = (r - c) * v + d
    * Revenue (r), cost per item (c), volume (v), fixed cost (d)
    
##  Quadratic Functions
  * Parabola 
    * y = ax*2 + bx + c
  * When a > 0, the function is convex (or concave up)
  * When a < 0, the function is concave down
  * Quadratic formula is used to find the roots of a function (where the graph touches x axis)
  * The roots of a quadractic
    * Values of x for when y = 0
    * There can be 2, 1, or 0 roots
  * Two methods for finding roots
    * Factoring
    * Quadractic equation
  
##  Quadratic Functions in Practice
  * Manufacturing widgets
  * Revenue = demand x price
  * Costs = cost x demand
  * Profits = Revenue x Costs
  * What are the root(s) of this equation? (price)
